    What the webpage does: I created this website about my cats because I love them very much and they are a big part of my life. 
    This page serves as a get to know them kind of thing. Additonally, there's some links at the bottom to sites that provide
    helpful info on how to take care of cats

            <img src="images/toby_pot.jpg" alt="Toby sleeping in a pot" width="260" height="325" class="center">

            <br>
            <p>Toby is the first cat I ever owned. I got him from my mother back in September of 2020. He was just a month old when I got him. <br>   
                Prior to having Toby, I considered myself more of a dog person. But he quickly changed my mind with his quirky personality. He has <br>
                an unusual personality for an animal. He's very skittish, but also very playful and energetic. He's very sweet, but isn't really <br>
                one for rubs and petting. He allows you to pet him for a little bit, but then will either gently bite your hand or move away. Toby <br>
                is a very comical cat because he's such a weirdo, so you'll often find him doing funny things, like sleeping in pots or in weird <br>
                positions. Toby now lives with my sister, but I still consider him part of my cat family for all the memories we shared together.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="about_mj">About MJ</h2>
            <img src="images/mj_box.jpeg" alt="MJ in a box" width="260" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/mj_wbabies.jpeg" alt="MJ with her babies" width="260" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/mj_cushion.jpeg" alt="MJ on the couch" width="260" height="325" class="center">
            <br>
            <p>Literally the sweetest cat that I have ever met. I got MJ in October 2021. My boyfriend found her on a post on Facebook. <br>
                She was in a home where she lived with a male cat that did not like her at all, so he was very aggressive and violent towards <br>
                her. Her owners were giving her away out of concern for her safety. We got her in a little box, and right from the get go, I saw <br>
                that she was a very gentle and sweet cat. She's never been aggressive and absolutely loves to be rubbed and petted. She likes <br>
                following me around my apartment and always greets me when I arrive home with a long string of meows. Probably my favorite cat <br>
                I've ever owned (don't tell the others). MJ currently lives with me.
            </p>

            <h2 id="about_loki">About Loki</h2>
            <img src="images/loki3.jpeg" alt="Loki looking at the camera" width="260" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/loki_floor.jpeg" alt="Loki sleeping on the floor" width="260" height="325" class="center">
            <br>
            <p>Loki is the cat I got most recently, back in May of 2022. My boyfriend got him from a friend of his who had a whole litter of <br>
                cats. He is a very sweet and gentle cat, despite his big and strong physique. Loki loves getting rubbed although he's very <br>
                shy and skittish sometimes. He's also very playful and energetic, but is never aggressive towards his owners. Loki is the first <br>
                cat I've ever met that has orange eyes. His eyes were the first thing that caught my eye when I saw him, they're beautiful. Loki <br>
                currently lives with me.
            </p>

            <h2 id="about_milo_lyla">About Milo and Lyla</h2>
            <img src="images/milo.jpeg" alt="Baby Milo" width="230" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/milo_bed.jpeg" alt="Milo sleeping" width="250" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/lyla.jpeg" alt="Baby Lyla" width="230" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/lyla_desk.jpeg" alt="Lyla on the desk" width="250" height="325" class="center">
            <img src="images/babies_sleeping2.jpeg" alt="Babies on the bed" width="260" height="325" class="center">
            <br>
            <p>Milo and Lyla are the babies of MJ and Loki. They were born 6 weeks ago, and they're growing so fast! They're already walking <br>
                and running by themselves. And they are super playful and energetic. Their latest accomplishment has been learning how to climb <br>
                the bed and jump off by themselves. Milo is the more playful and curious out of the two. He loves being close to people so you'll <br>
                often find him following you around trying to grab your foot. Lyla is more on the shy side, so she prefers to keep her distance. <br>
                They love to play and sleep together. They both currently live with me, and I cannot wait to see them grow together.
